# filesystem-simulator

A **C++ in-memory filesystem simulator** that models block storage, inodes, and directories.  
Supports creating, writing, reading, deleting, and listing files via an interactive shell.  
Includes custom exceptions for error handling (e.g., `FileMissingException`, `FileAlreadyExistsException`).
